This is my first project in the Odin Curriculum.

Final Project of Odin's HTML foundations.

It's a very basic HTML recipe website (or page). Some of the code I've used wasn't part of the curriculum. 
They haven't taught me that yet. However, I've learned some tricks and used them from the additional resources provided in the curriculum.

For example:

I learned how to add favicons through searching.
I learned how to center text through searching.
I learned how to change the color of HTML text and font size through Odin Project's additional resources.
I learned how to add backgrounds from one of the pages provided on Odin Project's additional resource sites.
I learned about nesting lists (ul inside ol or vice versa) from the pages provided on Odin Project's additional resource sites.

PS: I'm aware that we now use HTML5 and don't use the "center" method. However, for this project, I have used it anyway (since I don't know CSS yet).

Apart from all these, throughout the HTML Foundations lessons, I learned:

How to create an HTML5 boilerplate, the difference between the head and body elements, assigning a character set, and the importance of using UTF-8.
How to create lists, both ordered and unordered.
How to create absolute and relative links.
How to add images and the different image formats.
The importance of attributes such as "alt," "src," and "href," as well as understanding the differences between attributes.
