This is my first project in the Odin Curriculum. 

Final Project of Odin's HTML foundations.

It's a very basic fully HTML recipe web-site (or page).
Some of the things codes i've used wasn't a part of the curriculum. They haven't teached me (yet).
But from the additional resources given in the curriculum, i've learned some tricks and used it.

Such as;

-- I learned adding favicons through searching.
-- I learned how to center text through searching.
-- I learned how to change the color of an HTML text & font size through Odin Project's additional resources.
-- I learned adding backgrounds one of the pages given through Odin Project's additional resource sites.
-- I learned nesting lists (ul in ol or opposite) through pages given through Odin Project's additional resource sites.

!ps: I know that now we're using HTML5 we don't use the <center> method.-->
HOWEVER, just for this project, i've used, anyway... (welp, i don't know CSS yet)
