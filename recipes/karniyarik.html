        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Turkish eggplant recipe</strong> is a classic and well loved all around Turkey.</p> 
        <p>The name <strong>Karniyarik</strong> translates as <em><b><u>"split belly"</u></b></em> which is because of the fact that:</p> 
        <p><b><em>The eggplants are split after they're fried and are stuffed with a delicious minced meat mixture</em></b> and then baked to perfection.</p>

        <p>Eggplant is very popular in <strong>Turkey</strong> and there are so many Turkish recipes based on it.</p>
        <p>Such as our other recipe <a href="./patlicansalat.html"><strong>Smokey Eggplant Salad</strong></a></p>

        <!--I will nest a Description List into Unordered List (thanks to additional resources :) )-->

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggplants</strong>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Choosing the Eggplant:</dt>
                    <dd><em>I recommend you use smaller ones such as <strong>Italian eggplants</strong> for this recipe as they cook better. They are also softer and more tender.</em></dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
                
            <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Choosing the Ground Beef:</dt>
                    <dd><em>I recommend using <strong>lean ground beef</strong> for this recipe. You can also use ground lamb or a combination of both.</em></dd>
                </dl>

                    <dt>Choosing the Onions and Garlic:</dt>
                    <dd><em>Yellow onions or sweet onions would work in this recipe. <strong>It's best to mince garlic fresh</strong> instead of using packaged minced garlic.</em></dd>
                </dl>

                    <dt>Choosing the Green Pepper:</dt>

                    <dd><em>This tomato sauce is <strong>so much important</strong> for Karniyarik dish. <strong>Without this sauce</strong> the food will be <strong>lack of color and a deeper flavor</strong>.</em></dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            
            <!--I will add an absolute list to next code. Just the show that i know how to do it and to remember again.-->
