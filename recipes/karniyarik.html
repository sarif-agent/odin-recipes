        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Turkish eggplant recipe</strong> is a classic and well loved all around Turkey.</p> 
        <p>The name Karniyarik translates as <em>"split belly"</em> which is because of the fact that the eggplants are split after they're fried and are stuffed with a delicious minced meat mixture and then baked to perfection.</p>

        <p>Eggplant is very popular in <strong>Turkey</strong> and there are so many Turkish recipes based on it.</p>
        <p>Such as our other recipe <a href="./patlicansalat.html"><strong>Smokey Eggplant Salad</strong></a></p>

                        <dd><em>I recommend you use smaller ones such as <strong>Italian eggplants</strong> for this recipe as they cook better. They are also softer and more tender.</em></dd>

                        <dd><em>I recommend using <strong>lean ground beef</strong> for this recipe. You can also use ground lamb or a combination of both.</em></dd>
