            <li><b>STUFF GRAPE LEAVES</b>

                    <dt>STUFF AND ROLL THE GRAPE LEAVES</dt>
                    <dd>Start preparing your Dutch oven or pan by layering it with broken/unused grape leaves.</dd>
                    <dd>You can also use sliced tomatoes or potatoes to avoid the stuffed grape leaves from touching the bottom of the pot from burning.</dd>
                    <dd>Lay the leaf flat on a cutting board with the shiny side down.</dd>
                    <dd>Place about 1 tablespoon of the rice filling in the center of the leaf, close to where the stem was.</dd>
                    <dd>Fold the sides over the filling.</dd>
                    <dd>And roll, keep tucking the sides as you roll.</dd>
                    <dd>Roll them tightly enough but not too tight, leaving enough room for the rice to expand as they cook.</dd>
                    <dd>Arrange the stuffed grape leaves in rows neatly in your prepared dutch oven or pan.</dd>
                    <dd>Place them seam-side down and cover the bottom of the pan without leaving any space.</dd>
                    <dd>Layer a few slices of lemons on top of the arranged stuffed dolmas.</dd>
                    <dd>Dilute 1 teaspoon of tomato paste with 2 cups of water and add a tablespoon of olive oil.</dd>
                    <dd>Pour it over dolmas, until it almost covers them.</dd>
                    <dd>Bring it to a boil and gently simmer on low heat for an hour, or until the leaves are soft and the rice is fully cooked.</dd>
                    <dd>Let the dolmas rest for 15 to 20 minutes before transferring them to a serving plate.</dd>
                </dl>
